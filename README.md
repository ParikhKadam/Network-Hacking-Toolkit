# Network-Hacking-Toolkit
A mini-project in Python3 to perform attacks on a network.

This is my first mini project in hacking. I have seen many begineers in this field striving to understand tools available pre-installed in Operating Systems like Kali and Parrot OS.

In order to make this simple, here is a mini-project which will then be extended provided the ideas by public. I will first implement the basic functionalities. You can contribute here by finding flaws in code, suggesting new functionalities, and also by submitting your own code.

This project is and will be open for anyone to contribute. And **I am not responsible for anyone misusing this project**. This is just for increasing my own as well as others' knowledge in Network Hacking.

**Anyone can join this project and help it improve. Let's build and learn. This project needs support. Video courses regarding the concepts and how to use this toolkit in order to implement what you learn _may_ also be posted depending on availability of time and contributors**
